1. This is a basic level game which will be played in any terminal which supports .py file. But for better experience, I would suggest you to run in VScode.

LEVELS : There will be three levels - Beginner, Intermediate, Expert.

Points To Note Before Playing:

1. You have to choose any one level(Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) and answer each question within 5 seconds otherwise you will loose.
2. If you score 100 in Beginner level then you will reach Intermediate Level and if you are able to earn 100 points then you will be in the Expert level.
3. If you loose then you can type 1 to play again or 0 to exit.
